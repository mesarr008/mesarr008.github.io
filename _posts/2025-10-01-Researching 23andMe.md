## 23andMe Research

23andMe was launched in 2006 by Linda Avey, Anne Wojcicki, and Paul Cusenza to help people receive ancestry information just buying sending in a saliva sample. The process used genotyping rather than full genome sequencing which was enough to give ancestry information as well as some health risk signals. At first the product was very expensive and could cost as high was $999 in the early days but over time the price dropped significantly to around $99 in order to attract more customers. 

The main revenue came from sales of saliva kits being one time purchases by customers, and over time 23andMe tried to expand into health-based services, offering updates when new genetic discoveries emerged. Underneath all that 23andMe had deeper ambitions. They built a genetic database which could be used for research and was aso sold to pharmaceutical and reseach organizations.

Unfortunately there was one major weakness with this plan to gain revenue: a reliance on one time purchases, once a customer buys the kit once, they really dont need to purchase anything again which really limited revenue. Demand also lessned over time, sales dropped, customer growth slowed down and there was a big demand for a subsciption-type health service. As a result the company struggled and in March of 2025 23andMe filed for bankruptcy.
