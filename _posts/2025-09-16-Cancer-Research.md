## Lung Adenocarcinoma

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype of lung cancer. It being about 40% of cases, now the leading type of cancer seen in smokers and non-smokers. It is usually found through CT or PET scans. Major risk factors include smoking, air pollution, exposure to asbestos, and genetic susceptibility. Staging uses the TNM system (from I-IV) and subtypes include lepidic, papillary, micropapillary, acinar, and solid patterns. Treatment ranges from surgery and radiation when in early stages, and chemotherapy, immunotherapies, and targeted therapies for advanced stages. A 5 year survival rate is around 68-92% for stage I, but drops significantly to about 10% for stage IV.
