## Are You Defined By Your Genome?

If you're lookign for a one-word response, I'd say no. But if you asked me for more, I'd say your genome structures you, it doesnt define you.

Your genome really is like a first draft of a film. It's really only the raw materials. It sets the possibilites for what we're able to become but overall we are shaped by our environment. Your environment is so essential to your development. It includes everything from your geographic and socioeconomic conditions to your nutrition. If I was born in England instead of the United States I would be a completely different person. Even twins who share almost identical DNA diverge and grow into different people over time. So are we defined by our genome? No, our genome sets the stage but there are many factors that decided how our life unfolds.
